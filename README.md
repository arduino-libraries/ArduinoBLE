# STM32duinoBLE

This library is a fork of ArduinoBLE library to add the support of SPBTLE-RF, SPBTLE-1S, BLUENRG-M2SP, BLUENRG-LP and BLUENRG-M0 BLE modules.

It was successfully tested with the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 or X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2 or X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1 expansion board and
a NUCLEO-F401RE or NUCLEO-L476RG or NUCLEO-L053R8, with B-L475E-IOT01A and with STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1.

 - In order to use this library with STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1, you need to update the firmware of the SPBTLE-1S BLE module mounted on that board as described in the following wiki page:

- In order to use this library with X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1, you need to update the firmware of the BLUENRG-M2SP BLE module mounted on that expansion board as described in the following wiki page:
