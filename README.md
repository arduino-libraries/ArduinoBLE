[![Compile Examples Status](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/workflows/Compile%20Examples/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/actions?workflow=Compile+Examples) [![Spell Check Status](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/workflows/Spell%20Check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoBLE/actions?workflow=Spell+Check)

Enables Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity on the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, Arduino Nano 33 BLE, Arduino Portenta H7, Arduino Giga R1 and Arduino UNO R4 WiFi.

This library supports creating a Bluetooth® Low Energy peripheral & central mode.

For the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, and Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards, it requires the NINA module to be running [Arduino NINA-W102 firmware](https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw) v1.2.0 or later.

For the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, it requires the ESP32-S3 module to be running [firmware](https://github.com/arduino/uno-r4-wifi-usb-bridge) v0.2.0 or later.
