Enables Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity on the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, and Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

This library supports creating a Bluetooth® Low Energy peripheral & central mode.

For the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev.2, and Arduino Nano 33 IoT boards, it requires the NINA module to be running [Arduino NINA-W102 firmware](https://github.com/arduino/nina-fw) v1.2.0 or later.
